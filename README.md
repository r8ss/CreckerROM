# What is ExtremeROM Nexus?

ExtremeROM Nexus is a work-in-progress custom firmware for Samsung Galaxy devices. It's based on the latest and greatest
iteration of Samsung's UX and it also includes additional features and tweaks to ensure the best possible experience out
of the box.
It is based on the UN1CA build system which allows automatic downloading/extraction of the firmware, applying the
required patches and generating Odin and Heimdall flash packages for the specified target device.
ExtremeROM Nexus supports devices using the Exynos 990, Exynos 2100 and Exynos 2200 SoCs

Any form of contribution, suggestions, bug report or feature request for the project will be welcome.

# Building

Set up the build environment, then start the build with `m`:

```sh
source ./buildenv.sh [options] <target>
m
```

## Exynos990 full-integrity startup

The locked-bootloader Exynos990 flow uses the
[CVE-2024-56426 repository](https://github.com/Creeeeger/CVE-2024-56426)
for the initial EUB and temporary signed boot-chain startup. Start its local
control center before flashing a CreckerROM build:

```sh
python3 exynos990_control_center.py
```

Select the exact physical model and the intended fuse profile. If the phone is
not already in EUB, run **Flash Tampered Loader / Enter EUB**, then run the
temporary signed-chain step. The CVE control center establishes the bootloader
path; it does not replace flashing CreckerROM's complete generated package.

For a full-featured Samsung build, start CreckerROM from its repository root
with `--no-debloat` in the build-environment command. For example, the S20+
`G985F` command is:

```sh
source ./buildenv.sh --debug --official --encrypt --no-debloat --avb --avb-model G985F y2s
m
```

Replace both the AVB model and target codename for the physical device.
`--no-debloat` is required when the goal is to retain the complete available
Samsung feature set: the normal and ultra debloat profiles remove Samsung apps
or services on which some features depend. The small essential compatibility
list is still applied.

The default build writes Odin `AP_` and `CSC_` `.tar.md5` packages to `out/`,
and also creates an `<build-name>-heimdall` folder. AVB-enabled Exynos990
builds additionally produce a `BL_` package containing the re-signed bootloader
components.

| `--heimdall-only`                  | Disables Odin package creation and produces only the Heimdall flash folder.                                                                                                                                | Linux/Heimdall workflows or when individual flash images are required.                                                             |
| `--kernel-only`                    | Builds the kernel module and packages only signed `boot.img`, `dtbo.img`, and `vbmeta.img` in a Heimdall folder.

Exynos990 targets still require the exact `--avb-model`.                                                      |
| `--avb`                            | Enables full custom AVB image signing, vbmeta generation, and the platform's bootloader-signing flow.                                                                                                      | Complete AVB builds intended for flashing.                                                                                         |
| `--avb-low-security`               | Enables AVB but skips partition-image footer signing and omits partition descriptors from vbmeta. It implies `--avb`.                                                                                      | Development and recovery testing only; do not use it for a normal release.                                                         |
| `--avb-model <model>`              | Selects the exact Exynos990 handset model and its BL1 signing metadata. `--avb-model=<model>` is also accepted.                                                                                            | Every AVB, low-security AVB, kernel-only, or rollback build for an Exynos990 target.

| `--rollback`                       | Re-signs an old Exynos990 Odin firmware and replaces its recovery without running the custom-ROM modification flow. It implies AVB and Heimdall-only mode.                                                 | Creating a bootable rollback firmware set. Must be paired with `--rollback-firmware` and `--avb-model`.                            |
| `--rollback-firmware <name>`       | Selects an old downloaded firmware directory under `out/odin`, for example `SM-G985F_AUT`. `--rollback-firmware=<name>` is also accepted.                                                                  | Only with `--rollback`.                                                                                                            |
| `-h`, `--help`                     | Prints option help and the available target codenames.                                                                                                                                                     | Checking syntax or finding the correct target.                                                                                     |

The `m` command accepts `-f` or `--force`. A normal `m` invocation reuses the
prepared work directory when its source and build-affecting options have not
changed; `m --force` rebuilds that work directory before creating fresh flash
packages.

## Common examples

Full AVB encrypted build for an exact Exynos990 model:

```sh
source ./buildenv.sh --debug --official --encrypt --no-debloat --avb --avb-model G985F y2s
m
```

AVB Heimdall-only build:

```sh
source ./buildenv.sh --avb --avb-model G985F --heimdall-only y2s
m
```

Signed kernel test images only:

```sh
source ./buildenv.sh --kernel-only --avb-model G985F y2s
m
```

# Exynos990 TZAR / TZSW patching

When Samsung bootchain signing is enabled on Exynos990 targets:

- `TARGET_SAMSUNG_TZAR_PATCH_FILE` defaults to `/sbin/root_task`;
- `TARGET_SAMSUNG_TZAR_PATCH_TABLE` defaults to
  `security/samsung/patches/tzar_root_task_selected_patches.tsv`;
- `tzar.img` is unpacked, the selected member is patched from the TSV, and
  `tzar.img` is repacked and Stage-2 signed again;
- when `tzar.img` changes, encrypted `tzsw.img` is decrypted, userboot's
  embedded `startup.tzar` object hash table is patched, `tzsw.img` is
  re-encrypted with a refreshed `BiEn` digest, and `tzsw.img` is Stage-2 signed
  again. Set
  `TARGET_SAMSUNG_DECRYPTED_TZSW_PATH` only when you want to override the stock
  `tzsw.img` source used for that step.

# Exynos990 BL1 model selection

AVB-enabled Exynos990 builds require the exact phone model so the regenerated
`fwbl1.img` uses the correct Samsung BL1 signing tag:

```sh
source ./buildenv.sh --avb --avb-model G981B x1s
```

The supported values and metadata extracted from stock firmware are shown
below. Rollback revisions are decimal values and are applied to both AVB and
Samsung signatures.

| Model flag | Runtime artifact | Runtime firmware | Model ID | EVT  | Rollback |
|------------|------------------|------------------|----------|------|----------|
| `G780F`    | `G780F`          | `G780FXXSOFYJ1`  | `0x154`  | `11` | `24`     |
| `G980F`    | `G981B`          | `G981BXXSNHYB1`  | `0x143`  | `11` | `23`     |
| `G981B`    | `G981B`          | `G981BXXSNHYB1`  | `0x13D`  | `11` | `23`     |
| `G985F`    | `G986B`          | `G986BXXSNHYB1`  | `0x142`  | `11` | `23`     |
| `G986B`    | `G986B`          | `G986BXXSNHYB1`  | `0x13C`  | `11` | `23`     |
| `G988B`    | `G988B`          | `G988BXXSNHYB1`  | `0x13E`  | `11` | `23`     |
| `N980F`    | `N981B`          | `N981BXXSIHYH3`  | `0x153`  | `11` | `18`     |
| `N981B`    | `N981B`          | `N981BXXSIHYH3`  | `0x14E`  | `11` | `18`     |
| `N985F`    | `N986B`          | `N986BXXSIHYH3`  | `0x152`  | `11` | `18`     |
| `N986B`    | `N986B`          | `N986BXXSIHYH3`  | `0x14D`  | `11` | `18`     |

# Exynos990 rollback firmware builds

Rollback mode re-signs an old downloaded Odin firmware without running the
normal custom-ROM extraction, module, or patch flow. It preserves opaque image
contents, unpacks only the logical partitions in `super.img`, replaces stock
recovery with the target TWRP image, and uses the configured target firmware as
the source for the patched `sboot.bin`.

```sh
source ./buildenv.sh --rollback \
    --rollback-firmware SM-G985F_AUT \
    --avb-model G985F y2s
```

The Heimdall folder is written to
`out/rollback_SM-G985F_AUT_y2s-heimdall`. It includes the re-signed images,
`flash_all.sh`, and `sha256sums.txt`.
